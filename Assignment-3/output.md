**Question:** Explain recursion in programming.

**Response:**
Imagine you have a set of Russian nesting dolls. To find the smallest doll, you open the first doll, and if there's another doll inside, you open that one too. You keep doing this until you find the smallest doll that doesn't contain any more dolls.

Recursion in programming is like that! It's when a function solves a problem by calling *itself* to solve smaller parts of the same problem.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Base Case:** This is the smallest doll â€“ the simple case where the function knows the answer immediately and doesn't need to call itself again. It's the stopping point. Without it, the function would call itself forever!
2.  **Recursive Step:** This is like opening a doll to find another doll inside. The function calls *itself* with a slightly modified version of the original problem. This call should bring you closer to the base case.

Let's use a simple example: calculating the factorial of a number (like 5! = 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1).

Here's how you could do it with recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
  if n == 0:  # Base Case: factorial of 0 is 1
    return 1
  else:  # Recursive Step: n! = n * (n-1)!
    return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

In this code:

*   The **base case** is when `n` is 0. We know that `factorial(0)` is always 1, so we can just return the answer.
*   The **recursive step** is when `n` is not 0. In this case, we return `n` multiplied by the `factorial` of `n-1`.

So, `factorial(5)` becomes `5 * factorial(4)`, which becomes `5 * 4 * factorial(3)`, and so on, until we reach `factorial(0)`, which returns 1. Then, all the multiplications are done, and we get the final answer.
